# ADC_DAC_Sine_Sqaure_Potentiometer_App
Sinewave_Squarewave_ADC_DAC_Potentiometer
I have used internal 12-bit ADC and synchronised it with in-built potentiometer. 
I have also generated a sine waveform and square waveform by using DAC on STM32 Evaluation Kit and synchronised it with an external push button. 
By single click, Sinewave is generated and by clicking it second time, Square waveform is generated.
